Project Title: SwiftRide Driver & Rider Mobile App Development
Date: April 15, 2025
Prepared by: NovaStack Technologies

1. Project Overview
SwiftRide is launching a new ride-sharing platform and requires the design and development of two mobile applications (Rider and Driver) for iOS and Android. The apps will facilitate ride requests, real-time GPS tracking, fare calculation, in-app payments, and user ratings.

2. Scope of Work
NovaStack will provide end-to-end development for the SwiftRide mobile apps, including:
UI/UX design
Native mobile development (iOS & Android)
Backend API development
Integration with maps, payment gateway, and notifications
Admin dashboard for ride management
Deployment to App Store and Google Play
Basic training for admin portal usage

3. Deliverables
Design prototypes for both Rider and Driver apps
Functional iOS and Android apps
Backend API and database
Admin web portal
Source code repository access
Deployment to production stores
One-month post-launch support

4. Project Timeline
Discovery & Planning: April 22 – April 29
Design Phase: April 30 – May 15
Development Phase: May 16 – July 10
QA & Testing: July 11 – July 20
App Store Submission & Launch: July 25, 2025

5. Project Costs
Total Project Cost: $48,000
40% upfront ($19,200)
30% at development milestone
30% upon final delivery and app store approval

6. Acceptance Criteria
Apps must pass internal QA with no major bugs
Features implemented as per agreed wireframes and user stories
SwiftRide signs off after UAT
Apps successfully published to App Store and Google Play

7. Assumptions
Client will provide branding assets (logo, colors, etc.) before April 30
NovaStack will use Firebase for push notifications and real-time updates
Maps will be integrated via Google Maps SDK
Payment processing will use Stripe

8. Risks and Mitigation
App store rejection – Ensure early compliance with Apple/Google guidelines
Third-party API downtime – Use monitoring tools and fallback mechanisms
Timeline delays due to scope change – Weekly reviews and scope freeze before dev phase
