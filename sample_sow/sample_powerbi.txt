This will enable NewLogistic to make data-driven decisions to optimize operations and costs. 

b. Roadmap 
The roadmap includes the following key milestones: 
Requirement Gathering and Analysis: Understand the data sources, KPIs, and reporting needs.
Design Phase: Create a high-level architecture and detailed design for the dashboard.
Development Phase: Build the dashboard in iterative sprints.
Testing Phase: Conduct rigorous testing to ensure data accuracy and usability.
Deployment and Rollout: Deploy the dashboard to production and provide training to end-users.


2. Project Management Methodology
a. Agile Methodology 
The project will follow the Agile methodology to ensure flexibility and iterative progress. The project will be divided into sprints, each lasting two weeks. 

b. Detailed Design/Mobilization 
Conduct workshops with stakeholders to finalize requirements.
Prepare a detailed design document, including data flow diagrams and mockups.
c. Development/Sprint Cycle 
Sprint planning will be conducted at the beginning of each sprint.
